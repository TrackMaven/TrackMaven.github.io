Since this is the first year that TrackMaven has our Engine Room blog, this will be our first year in review. But I am hoping that this is a trend that will continue as we grow! We want to highlight a lot of what we did during 2014, and show our incredible growth as a department. Head over to see our company-wide [2014 in review](http://trackmaven.com/2014/).

So here are the numbers:

* +4 Engineers. We started 2014 with 4 engineers and have doubled in size! There was definitely some growing pains, but checkout Farhan's [onboarding post](/blog/onboarding-at-trackmaven/) to see how far we've come!
* +8,965 code commits. Even as fast as our team has been expanding so has the codebase for TrackMaven. We are constantly trying to provide the best platform for digital marketers and commiting code helps us get there.
* +204 releases. Even thought continuous deployment was something we added to our stack around June of 2014, we were still able to push 204 releases of the application to our customers.

We also released some amazing features & enhancements in 2014!

* We migrated completely from Heroku to AWS to give the engineers a finer sense of control of the application.
* We secured our application with SSL to provide the upmost secure connection with our customers. (Read how to set up HTTPS [here](/blog/setting-up-https-security/).)
* We released an amazing data visualization suite using D3. (You can read more on how to integrate D3 in Angular.js [here](/blog/building-a-testable-d3-charting-application-within-angularjs/))
* We scaled everything! Just like the task of doubling our engineering staff, we were able to scale TrackMaven, more than doubling our infrastructure.
* We introduced ElasticSearch into our cluster to give our customers access to blazing fast search of our activity feed.

We have a lot more planned for 2015 and will be writing about it here on the Engine Room! Here's to an amazing 2015.
