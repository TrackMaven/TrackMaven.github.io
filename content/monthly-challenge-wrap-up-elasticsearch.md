Thanks to everyone who came out and presented at our inaugural [Monthly Challenge meetup](http://www.meetup.com/TrackMaven-Monthly-Challenge/)! We had a great variety of Elasticsearch-related projects. Here's a quick rundown from the night:

* Our [jumpstart blog post](http://engineroom.trackmaven.com/blog/first-monthly-challenge-elasticsearch/) introduced a basic analysis of top reddit IAMA posts using Python's [elasticsearch](https://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/) client, then visualized some trip history data from [Capital Bikeshare](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data) using [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/).
* [Josh Finnie](https://twitter.com/joshfinnie) shows how to search and "recommend" beer selections with Elasticsearch. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/joshfinnie/beer-rec) and [slides](http://www.joshfinnie.com/talks/beer-search-and-recs-in-es/#/)!
* [Tom Panning](https://twitter.com/TomPanning) analyzes NIH data available through the [RePORT portal](http://report.nih.gov/). Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tpanning/nih-report)!
* [Matt Camilli](https://twitter.com/mlcamilli) enlightens us on how to use headless browsers to scrape Steam game reviews and put them in Elasticsearch. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mlcamilli/SteamReviewParser)!
* [Will Sankey](https://twitter.com/wsankey) explores hospital violations using public CMS data. Check out the [presentation slides](http://slides.com/williamsankey/trackmaven-meetup-deck-11-12-2014) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wsankey/elastic_health) of Ruby code.
* [Cameron Maske](https://twitter.com/cameronmaske) shows off using Elasticsearch with geo spatial data! Take a look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cameronmaske/geo-dc) for grabbing geospatial data from DC.

Next month's topic will be *natural language processing*; [RSVP to the meetup](http://www.meetup.com/TrackMaven-Monthly-Challenge/events/218683569/) and stay tuned for a blog post with some details to get you started. Some possible options...
