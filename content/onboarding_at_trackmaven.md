Summary: In this post, I'll talk why Onboarding a new engineer is so important, and how it went during my first month at TrackMaven


This will mostly stay in the realm of onboarding as an engineer.



## What is Onboarding?

Onboarding is the mechanism in which you take new employees and turn them into **autuonmous**, **confident** and **productive** members of the company. 

Let's dive a little deeper into these three tenants and how they specfically apply to engineering onboarding.

**Productivity** : how quickly can someone setup their local dev environment, deploy code, run tests, and basically if they are able to contribute to the code base. What really shines in this tenant is how automated are all the proceses and what are the tools are being used within the team.

**Autonomy**: how much supervision do they need, are they able to choose what types of problems they want to workon. This goes along way and is just a basic part of human satisfaction.

**Cofidence**: This is probably the most imporant metric of them all is it ties into the other two. Its all about creating engineers who believe they are valuable and feel that they can actually enact change. It's important to note that this measure is only imporant for the indivudal but for the entire team as it helps create the space for emergent leaders.



## Teams & Onboarding

I think we all can agree that software is not written by single person ([...Well sometimes it is....](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/gods-lonely-programmer)), but in teams. And teams matter, teams are resonsible for building great features throughout history, and onboarding is no different. Onboarding is a team endeavor, and helps spread some of the builtin insitutioal knowledge that is inherent in engineering.



Just as great features are built with a team, onboarding is a team endeavor. It is generally a bad idea to a single person onboard a new engineer. 
 



Now that we have gotten that out of the way. It's time to share my exeriences at TrackMaven.

## My experience



### Productivity
----
I was completely blown away at the level of automation that I was introduced to during my first week at trackmaven. My local dev environment took a mere hour and half. So much of that is due to the awesome tooling we have. **Docker** and + **Fig** makes setting up isolated services a breeze, not to mention having a hand-rolled CLi for all stages of the application life cyce(start, update, destroy). Another thing that impressed was the amount of testing that has been written for the applcaiton. There is seriously no way to better onboard someone then to have a grea suite of tests to help an engineer know when he broke something. Lastly out deoployment starget was just as impressive. We use **Ansible** and **Fabri** to deploy to our different environments.

Because of the of how well documented and autmated our process was for shipping code I was able to push code out within the first couple of days. It was just a great way for me to feel that I was contributing to a team very quicly. I didn't understand how the entire application worked but being able to have such a streamlined and automated process really helped me feel confident.


### Autonomy
---

Onboarding checklist was such a great resource to have. Intead being waiting ot be told what the tod I was given progressivly more autonmy to cross things off my list and in wthin my first month, i've done pretty much everything. 



### Confidence
---
Pair programing is something that we just do at trackmaven. I was paired with 75 % of the engineers on our team which was just a great way to see a ton of awesome tools that my co workers were using (everybody loves to be more productive at work ..... right?), and to really understand to see how features are built out, where things are located, what are the important styles and conventions that we adhere to.



### Other Awesomeness

I have 1 on 1 with the VP of engineer and it was probably the single greatest thing I have expereinced as an engineer. It was a great space to get feedback on things I could improve upon, but how the process coudl be better handled since I had just gone into this. And goal setting is really important.
